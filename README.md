Just a simple demo, which could help you draw graphs, like lines, rectangles and rounds, on the picture.

The fatures this demo has:
1. you could drag a picture(.png, .jpg, .bmp and so on) to the window, and check it;

2. you could drag the picture in the window by moving the mouse and zoom in and out it by rotating the wheel;

3. you could draw the line by clicking the picture, holding and releasing the mouse, same way, you could draw the rectangle and rounds;

4. you could write the data about the graphs in a ini file. For a line, it's the vertex of both sides; for a rectangle, it's the center spot, the width and the height; for the rounds, it's the center spot and the radius.

5. Maybe I could add the function which support you change the graphs(?)
